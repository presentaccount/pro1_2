In this analysis, we will not focus on the Score, but only the positive/negative sentiment of the recommendation. \n","\n","To do so, we will work on Amazon's recommendation dataset, we will build a Term-doc incidence matrix using term frequency and inverse document frequency ponderation. When the data is ready, we will load it into predicitve algorithms. In the end, we hope to find a \"best\" model for predicting the recommendation's sentiment.\n","\n","## Loading the data\n","As we only want to get the global sentiment of the recommendations (positive or negative), we will purposefully ignore all Scores equal to 3. If the score id above 3, then the recommendation wil be set to \"postive\". Otherwise, it will be set to \"negative\". \n","\n","The data will be split into an training set and a test set with a test set ratio of
